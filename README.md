This project is a personal dashboard. It has a lot of components such as google calendar, useful links, the last video of your youtube playlist, or even the 2 upcoming RLCS matches ! I designed it to be a cosy place, like a lobby.

Please note that this project is designed to be used only by me, so ther is a lot of configuration in order to make it work on your system.

The Youtube component use the [Youtube data api v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs?hl=en) and [Google Oauth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2?hl=en) to log into to your personal Youtube account and fetch your playlist.

The project uses a .env file wich contain environement variables such as Google client Id, your playlist Id, or your weather api key.
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

Follow [these](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en) steps to embed your Google Calendar.

Everything should be working.
