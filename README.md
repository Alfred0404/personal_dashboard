This project is a personal dashboard. It has a lot of components such as google calendar, useful links, the last video of your youtube playlist, or even the 2 upcoming RLCS matches ! I designed it to be a cosy place, like a lobby.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project stack

## Configuration

The Youtube component use the [Youtube data api v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs?hl=en) and [Google Oauth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2?hl=en) to log into to your personal Youtube account and fetch your playlist.
